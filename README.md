# Canopy

### The plan
A multiplayer logistics game all about transporting water back to the central tree. Watering the tree exapnds the area you can explore (the "canopy") and unlocks 
upgrades as you hit certain milestones. The last milestone will allow everyone to escape the planet together, but the catch is that you can escape by yourself
by using up a ton of water to build a personal escape portal. Escaping will give you a currency you can use to build more advanced buildings or for cosmetics, but
that's only if we actually get close to finishing the game. We want to see how greed will play out in a game like this, all while developing our skills as coders.

However, this game is meant to be a jumpstart to the actual game we want to develop, we'll see how far we can get on this in 2-3 months, see if we can make a finished-ish
product, call it a day, and move onto the real project. Or we might stick with this if the idea turns out to really be working.

### Side note
As you can probably tell the code I have is a lot cleaner, I made a format for myself (and the others) to follow that kind of looks like C++ where functions are defined
at the top and then triggered during certain events at the bottom, with comment blocks over each function to help each other understand what it does.
